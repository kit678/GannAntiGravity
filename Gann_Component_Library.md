| TXT_Pg14_4 | Pg 14 (Text) | WHERE TO PLACE STOP LOSS ORDERS: You must place STOP LOSS orders below the lows of swings and not just below the lows on the daily chart. |  |
| TXT_Pg14_6 | Pg 14 (Text) | STOP LOSS orders placed below closing prices on the daily or weekly chart are much safer and less likely to be caught because you are moving your STOPS according to the trend. |  |
| TXT_Pg14_8 | Pg 14 (Text) | The swings or reversals in a market are the prices to place STOP LOSS orders one way or the other. |  |
| TXT_Pg14_9 | Pg 14 (Text) | It is of great importance to know where to place a STOP LOSS order properly. |  |
| TXT_Pg14_10 | Pg 14 (Text) | Grains selling below $1 a bushel, a STOP LOSS order is as a rule safe and caught less of the time when you place it 1¢ below the bottom and especially 1¢ under closing prices, or 1¢ above closing pric... |  |

| TXT_Pg43_8 | Pg 43 (Text) | Your stop loss orders should be 1 to 2¢ per bushel under a daily bottom or under the Trend Line bottom, according to the rules. |  |

| TXT_Pg45_6 | Pg 45 (Text) | HOW TO USE STOP LOSS ORDERS With this Method you must always use a stop loss order 1, 2, or 3¢ below the bottom or above the tops made by the Trend Indicator. |  |
| TXT_Pg45_8 | Pg 45 (Text) | When the market is moving slowly, you can use 1¢ stop loss orders with greater success and larger profits, but when an option fluctuates rapidly the move will often go 1½¢ over a top or under a bottom... |  |
| TXT_Pg45_9 | Pg 45 (Text) | A stop loss order 3¢ under a Trend Line Bottom or over a Trend Line top will be caught less frequently than a 1 or 2¢ stop loss orders. |  |

| TXT_Pg45_11 | Pg 45 (Text) | When Wheat is selling at very high prices, then you have to put your stop loss orders further away, but in most cases I never advise using a stop loss order more than 3¢ per bushel away. |  |
| TXT_Pg45_12 | Pg 45 (Text) | However, after Wheat has had a big advance or a big decline and you have big profits, then you can either follow up with stop loss orders 1¢ under each day’s bottom or above the top, or 3¢ per bushel ... |  |

| TXT_Pg47_0 | Pg 47 (Text) | GrM-5 The safest buying point is when an option makes a triple bottom near the same level, protected with a stop loss order not more than 1¢ under the lowest level of the triple bottom. |  |
| TXT_Pg47_1 | Pg 47 (Text) | Rule 3 –SELLING AT DOUBLE OR TRIPLE TOPS This rule is just the reverse of Rule 2. |  |

| TXT_Pg48_9 | Pg 48 (Text) | Then, when you get into this run, buy every 5¢ up, protecting with a stop loss order 1¢ under each day’s bottom or 1¢ under the last Trend Line bottom. |  |
| TXT_Pg48_10 | Pg 48 (Text) | By following up with a stop loss order 1¢ under the Trend Line bottom, you not get out until the main trend has changed. |  |

| TXT_Pg53_17 | Pg 53 (Text) | Don’t forget to always use stop loss orders. |  |
| TXT_Pg55_9 | Pg 55 (Text) | In other words, if the 3-day Chart shows down trend, it is always better to sell short on rallies using the minor trend chart for placing stop loss orders. |  |
| TXT_Pg55_16 | Pg 55 (Text) | By carefully watching these Resistance levels in connection with your Trend Indicators, you can make a greater success and trade with closer stop loss orders. |  |
| TXT_Pg57_8 | Pg 57 (Text) | When an option advances or declines to this halfway point, you should sell or buy with a stop loss order 1, 2, or 3¢ according to whether the option is selling at very high or very low levels. |  |

| TXT_Pg59_6 | Pg 59 (Text) | If we could bore a hole thru the earth and then drop a ball, momentum would carry it beyond the gravity center, but when it slowed down, it would finally settle on the exact center. |  |

| TXT_Pg60_8 | Pg 60 (Text) | Watch for culmination around the 38th to 52nd day after a move starts, and if bottom or top is not made around this time, then watch for the next movement around the 66th to 70th day. |  |

| TXT_Pg106_1 | Pg 106 (Text) | On the square of 90, which you will receive with these instructions, note how equal angles drawn from the top and from the bottom prove themselves by the point at which they cross. |  |
| TXT_Pg106_2 | Pg 106 (Text) | For example: The angle of 8 x 1 drawn from "0" and the angle of 8 x 1 drawn from "90" down both cross at 45, 5-5/8 points over from "0" counting to the right. |  |
| TXT_Pg106_3 | Pg 106 (Text) | Then, the angle of 4 x 1 from "0" and the angle of 4 x 1 down from 90, you will notice, cross at 11¼ on 45, equidistant from the other angle and twice the measure. |  |
| TXT_Pg106_4 | Pg 106 (Text) | The reason why these angles prove this way is because the 45° angle or 45 points or degrees from "0" to 45 is one-half of 90. |  |
| TXT_Pg106_5 | Pg 106 (Text) | Therefore, parallel angles beginning at "0" going up and at 90 coming down, must cross on a 45° angle or at the gravity center. |  |

| TXT_Pg107_11 | Pg 107 (Text) | For example: The 45° angle divided the space from "0" to "90" in half. |  |
| TXT_Pg107_12 | Pg 107 (Text) | The angle of 135° is simply another angle of 45° because it is one-half of the next quadrant between 90 and 180. |  |

| TXT_Pg136_20 | Pg 136 (Text) | SQUARING WEEKLY TIME PERIODS The year contains 52 weeks and the square of this in time is 52 by 52. |  |
| TXT_Pg136_21 | Pg 136 (Text) | Therefore, you can make up a square of 52 wide and 52 high: put on all of the angles from 0; then, chart weekly high and low prices of an option in this square. |  |
| TXT_Pg136_22 | Pg 136 (Text) | Example: If the low price of an option is 50, then the top of this weekly square would be 52 added to 50, which makes 102 as top of the square. |  |
| TXT_Pg136_23 | Pg 136 (Text) | As long as price stays above 50 and moves up, it will be working in the weekly square of 52. |  |

| TXT_Pg177_2 | Pg 177 (Text) | In this way you will be able to make 10 consecutive trades on your capital and the market would have to beat you 10 consecutive times to wipe out your capital, which it will not do. |  |
| TXT_Pg177_3 | Pg 177 (Text) | Whatever amount of capital you use to trade with, follow this rule: Divide your capital into 10 equal parts and never risk more than 10% of your capital on any one trade. |  |
| TXT_Pg177_4 | Pg 177 (Text) | Should you lose for 3 consecutive times, then reduce your trading unit and only risk 10% of your remaining capital. |  |

| TXT_Pg177_9 | Pg 177 (Text) | Use a capital of $1,000 to trade in Cotton when it is selling under 30¢ per pound. |  |
| TXT_Pg177_10 | Pg 177 (Text) | From 12¢ to 20¢, use $1,500 for each 100 bales. |  |

| TXT_Pg178_1 | Pg 178 (Text) | When markets are abnormal and at prices like 1946, 1947 and 1948, brokers require margin or $1,500 to $2,000 to trade in 50 bales. |  |
| TXT_Pg178_2 | Pg 178 (Text) | Under these conditions when there are wide fluctuations you can trade and risk 40 to 50 points on each trade, but try to keep your stop loss order 20 to 30 points above tops and below bottoms when pos... |  |
| TXT_Pg178_13 | Pg 178 (Text) | WITHIN DAY By a "within day" I mean a day when an option makes a higher bottom but does not make a higher top than a previous day; in other words, it remains within the range of the previous day. |  |

| TXT_Pg179_5 | Pg 179 (Text) | HOW TO USE STOP LOSS ORDERS With this Method you must always use a stop loss order, 10, 20, 30 or 40 points below the bottoms or above the tops made by the Trend Indicator. |  |

| TXT_Pg179_8 | Pg 179 (Text) | When Cotton is moving slowly, you can use 10-point stop loss orders with greater success and larger profits, but when it fluctuates rapidly the move will often go 15 points over a top or under a botto... |  |
| TXT_Pg179_9 | Pg 179 (Text) | A stop loss order 30 points under a Trend Line bottom or over a Trend Line top will be caught less frequently than the 10 or 20-point stop loss orders. |  |
| TXT_Pg179_10 | Pg 179 (Text) | However, as a general rule, I only advocate using 30-point stop loss orders in very active markets. |  |
| TXT_Pg179_11 | Pg 179 (Text) | SPACE CHARTS You can keep charts of every 10, 20, or 30 point move up or down, but the most important in active markets is the 20-point chart. |  |
| TXT_Pg179_12 | Pg 179 (Text) | When Cotton breaks 10 points under a bottom on the 20-point chart or crosses a top on the 20-point chart by 10 points, it indicates a change in trend. |  |

| TXT_Pg181_0 | Pg 181 (Text) | CM-5 The safest buying point is when an option makes a triple bottom near the same level, protecting with a stop loss order not more than 20 points under the lowest level of the triple bottom. |  |
| TXT_Pg181_2 | Pg 181 (Text) | Sell against double or triple tops with a stop loss order 10, 20, or 30 points above the top, but on a third top never use more than a 20-point stop loss order because, as a general rule, when an opti... |  |

| TXT_Pg182_4 | Pg 182 (Text) | If you have pyramided until you have 500 bales, then you should have an order in to sell 600 bales on stop, which would put you short 100 bales to start a new deal. |  |
| TXT_Pg182_6 | Pg 182 (Text) | But remember, when Cotton has moved 300 to 350 points in your favor, you must watch for a change in trend and be careful about buying or selling another lot on which you would have to take a loss. |  |
| TXT_Pg182_7 | Pg 182 (Text) | In active high-priced markets the move may run 500 to 720 points before an important change in trend. |  |
| TXT_Pg182_10 | Pg 182 (Text) | Then, when you get into this run, buy every 40 to 50 points up, protecting with a stop loss order 20 points under each day’s bottom or 20 points under the last Trend Line bottom. |  |
| TXT_Pg182_11 | Pg 182 (Text) | By following up with a stop loss order 20 points under the Trend Line bottom, you will not get out until the main trend has changed. |  |

| TXT_Pg184_0 | Pg 184 (Text) | CM-8 Remember that breaking 10 points under a daily bottom or going 10 points over a daily top does not change the trend. |  |
| TXT_Pg184_1 | Pg 184 (Text) | RULE #15: MAIN TREND INDICATOR After a prolonged advance, never consider that the main trend has changed until a bottom made by the 3-day Chart has been broken. |  |
| TXT_Pg184_4 | Pg 184 (Text) | (See page 11.) RULE #16: BREAKAWAY POINTS Watch the point and price from which the last move starts up and when that price is broken, consider that the main trend is changing to the downside. |  |
| TXT_Pg184_10 | Pg 184 (Text) | RULE #17: SECOND AND THIRD HIGHER BOTTOMS AND LOWER TOPS Watch the second and third higher bottoms. |  |
| TXT_Pg184_14 | Pg 184 (Text) | RULE #18: SECTIONS OF A MOVE It is important to study the different sections or moves that Cotton makes between the first low level and the first, second, third, fourth, or fifth tops of a move. |  |
| TXT_Pg184_19 | Pg 184 (Text) | Watch the first rally, or first reaction after top or bottom has been made, and if Cotton runs 50 or 60 points, then watch the action of the next move of 50 to 60 points up or down. |  |

| TXT_Pg185_3 | Pg 185 (Text) | By 30 full-points I mean, for example, from 630 low, a rally to 660 would be 30 full-points. |  |
| TXT_Pg185_4 | Pg 185 (Text) | If the low was 628, we would not count 30 full-points until the option rallied to 660. |  |
| TXT_Pg185_6 | Pg 185 (Text) | Suppose it advances to 668 and has not had a 30 full-point reaction for some time. |  |
| TXT_Pg185_7 | Pg 185 (Text) | Then if it declines to 630, I would consider it a 30 full- point reaction and an indication that the minor trend is reversing. |  |
| TXT_Pg185_8 | Pg 185 (Text) | In that case, if Cotton only declined to 638, or even to 631, we would not count it a full 30-point reaction, because full points are based on even figures. |  |

| TXT_Pg205_1 | Pg 205 (Text) | After more than 45 years of research, tests and practical applications, I have perfected and proved the most important angles to be used in determining the trend of the Cotton Market. |  |
| TXT_Pg205_6 | Pg 205 (Text) | For example: If you should count across the bottom of your chart 120 spaces, which represents 120 days, weeks or months, then you begin at "0" and number vertically on your chart up to 120, then from ... |  |

| TXT_Pg206_2 | Pg 206 (Text) | Refer to Form "I" where I have drawn the square of 90. |  |
| TXT_Pg206_3 | Pg 206 (Text) | You will note that this is 90 high and 90 wide – in other words, 90 up and 90 across. |  |
| TXT_Pg206_7 | Pg 206 (Text) | Note angle marked "A", which divides each of the smaller squares into 2 equal parts and runs from "0" to "90" diagonally. |  |
| TXT_Pg206_8 | Pg 206 (Text) | This is a diagonal line moving on a 45-degree angle and divides the large square into 2 equal parts. |  |
| TXT_Pg206_9 | Pg 206 (Text) | Then note angle "B" at "45" running horizontally across. |  |
| TXT_Pg206_11 | Pg 206 (Text) | Note angle "C", which is a vertical line, running up from "45" which is one-half of "90". |  |
| TXT_Pg206_12 | Pg 206 (Text) | This crosses at the center or half-way point at "45", where the other angles cross, dividing the Square into 2 equal parts. |  |
| TXT_Pg206_13 | Pg 206 (Text) | Then note angle "D", which forms another 45-degree angle moving from the N.W. corner to the S.E. corner, crossing "45" at the exact half-way point. |  |

| TXT_Pg207_1 | Pg 207 (Text) | PATTERN CHART FOR GEOMETRICAL ANGLES The square of 90, or the Pattern Chart, shows all the measured angles that are important to use in determining the position of an option. |  |
| TXT_Pg207_2 | Pg 207 (Text) | These angles are as follows: 3-3/4, 7-1/2, 15, 18-3/4, 26-1/4, 30, 33-3/4, 37-1/2, 45, 52-1/2, 60, 63-3/4, 71-1/4, 75, 82-1/2, 86-1/4, and 90 degrees. |  |
| TXT_Pg207_5 | Pg 207 (Text) | On the square of 90, which you will receive with these instructions, note how equal angles drawn from the top and from the bottom prove themselves by the point at which they cross. |  |
| TXT_Pg207_6 | Pg 207 (Text) | For example: The angle of 8 x 1 drawn from "0" and the angle of 8 x 1 drawn from "90" down both cross at 45, 5-5/8 points over from "0" counting to the right. |  |
| TXT_Pg207_7 | Pg 207 (Text) | Then, the angle of 4 x 1 from "0" and the angle of 4 x 1 down from 90, you will notice, cross at 11-1/4 on 45, equal distance from the other angle and twice the measure. |  |
| TXT_Pg207_8 | Pg 207 (Text) | The reason these angles prove this way is because the 45-degree angle or 45 periods of time from "0" to 45 is one-half of 90. |  |
| TXT_Pg207_9 | Pg 207 (Text) | Therefore, parallel angles beginning at "0" going up and at 90 coming down must cross on a 45-degree angle or at the gravity center. |  |
| TXT_Pg207_10 | Pg 207 (Text) | HOW TO DRAW ANGLES FROM A LOW POINT RECORDED BY COTTON FIRST IMPORTANT GEOMETRICAL ANGLE The first, and always the most important, angle to draw is a 45-degree angle or a moving-average that moves up ... |  |
| TXT_Pg207_11 | Pg 207 (Text) | This is a 45-degree angle because it divides the Space and Time Periods into two equal parts. |  |
| TXT_Pg207_12 | Pg 207 (Text) | As long as the market or option stays above the 45-degree angle, it is in a strong position and indicates higher prices. |  |
| TXT_Pg207_13 | Pg 207 (Text) | You can buy every time it rests on the 45-degree angle with a stop-loss order 10, 20 or 30 points under the 45-degree angle, but remember the rule: Never use a stop-loss order more than 50 points away... |  |
| TXT_Pg207_14 | Pg 207 (Text) | Unless Cotton is near the low levels or just starting in a Bull Market or selling at a very low price, I always use a stop-loss order 10 points under the 45-degree angle. |  |
| TXT_Pg207_15 | Pg 207 (Text) | If this angle is broken by 10 points, you will usually find that the trend has changed at least temporarily and the option will go lower. |  |
| TXT_Pg207_16 | Pg 207 (Text) | THE W.D. GANN MASTER COMMODITIES COURSE (www.groups.yahoo.com/group/wheelsinthesky) Page 204 |  |
| TXT_Pg208_3 | Pg 208 (Text) | You can beat the market by trading against the 45-degree angle alone if you stick to the rule: Wait to buy on the 45-degree angle or wait to sell it against the 45-degree angle. |  |
| TXT_Pg208_4 | Pg 208 (Text) | SECOND IMPORTANT ANGLE – 2 x 1 This angle moves up at the rate of 20 points per day or 2 spaces of price for 1 period of time. |  |
| TXT_Pg208_5 | Pg 208 (Text) | On the monthly chart it would move up 40 points per month and on the weekly chart it would move up at the rate of 30 points per week. |  |
| TXT_Pg208_6 | Pg 208 (Text) | The Space between the 45-degree angle and the vertical angle divided into 2 parts makes the angle of 2 x 1 measure 63-3/4 degrees. |  |
| TXT_Pg208_7 | Pg 208 (Text) | That is why it is the next strongest angle above the 45-degree angle. |  |
| TXT_Pg208_8 | Pg 208 (Text) | As long as an option holds above this angle it is in a very strong position because this angle is more acute than the 45-degree angle. |  |
| TXT_Pg208_9 | Pg 208 (Text) | When an option breaks under this angle it is in a weaker position and indicates that it will go lower and the next support angle is the 45-degree angle. |  |

| TXT_Pg209_1 | Pg 209 (Text) | FOURTH IMPORTANT ANGLE – 8 x 1 The angle of 8 x 1 or the one that moves up 8 spaces per day, week or month, measures 82-1/2 degrees. |  |
| TXT_Pg209_7 | Pg 209 (Text) | For Example: The 45- degree angle divides the space from "0" to "90" in half. |  |
| TXT_Pg209_9 | Pg 209 (Text) | 225 and 315 in a circle are also 45-degree angles. |  |
| TXT_Pg209_10 | Pg 209 (Text) | Therefore, all of the angles valuable in determining the trend of an option are found between "0" and "90" degrees. |  |

| TXT_Pg244_21 | Pg 244 (Text) | The reasons were as follows: Based on the angles on the daily high and low chart the angle of 4 x 1, which moves 2- 1/2 points per day from the first top at 4760 made December 6, 1948 crossed at 5020.... |  |

| TXT_Pg244_26 | Pg 244 (Text) | The time from the first important top on December 6, 1948, was close to 5 months and the angle from this top called the top exactly. |  |

| TXT_Pg244_30 | Pg 244 (Text) | This would give an angle of 5 x 4 or about 39 degrees, moving up at the rate of 8 points per day, instead of the 45° angle which moves 10 points per day. |  |

| TXT_Pg245_12 | Pg 245 (Text) | This was the first day since April 18 that the market had broken the low of the previous day and closed under. |  |

| TXT_Pg245_20 | Pg 245 (Text) | Third move up 4775 to 5025 -- total gain 250 points. |  |
| TXT_Pg245_21 | Pg 245 (Text) | This was 25 points less than the first gain and 40 points less than the second gain up. |  |

| TXT_Pg245_25 | Pg 245 (Text) | And the last advance from April 18 was 11 market days, therefore, when the market declines more than 11 days it will over balance the greatest time period. |  |
| TXT_Pg245_26 | Pg 245 (Text) | When it declines more than 75 points it will over balance the last price declines or space reversal, and indicate lower prices. |  |

| TXT_Pg268_16 | Pg 268 (Text) | RULE 7 –PRICE MOVES Price moves of 100 to 125 points are about the average reaction in a Bull Market, that is, when the main trend is up as shown by the 2-Day Chart. |  |

| TXT_Pg282_22 | Pg 282 (Text) | When October Eggs sold at 5275, on April 13th and April 17th 1953, they were 180° from 4375, and within 5 points or 5° of 180° from 1500. |  |
| TXT_Pg282_24 | Pg 282 (Text) | 1/4 of the circle is 90° – 1/3 is 120° and 1/2 is 180°. |  |
| TXT_Pg282_26 | Pg 282 (Text) | Eggs sold at 5275, on April 17th, they were 2 circles of 360° and 1/2 or 180 over, from the low of 4375. |  |
| TXT_Pg282_27 | Pg 282 (Text) | The opposition of the 180° is the strongest resistance points, and that is why heavy selling took place at 5275 and caused prices to react. |  |
| TXT_Pg282_28 | Pg 282 (Text) | Note the 5275 is within 5° of November 22nd, the triangle point of 240, therefore, the price was ahead of time. |  |
| TXT_Pg282_29 | Pg 282 (Text) | To be on Time, any around April 30th, 1953, the price would have to be at 5075. |  |
| TXT_Pg282_30 | Pg 282 (Text) | Refer to your chart for the weekly high and low, which starts at 1500 and shows each 25 points in the square. |  |
| TXT_Pg282_31 | Pg 282 (Text) | This chart starts at zero, May 28th, 1932. |  |
| TXT_Pg282_32 | Pg 282 (Text) | And, 5275 is at the 45° angle, and the date is July 14th. |  |
| TXT_Pg282_33 | Pg 282 (Text) | Therefore, from May 28th, 1932, in the 21st year, the price is ahead of time, and should the price decline below 5160 it will be below the time period of May 28th. |  |
| TXT_Pg282_34 | Pg 282 (Text) | And, to be on Time, around April 20th, price would have to be 50¢ per dozen. |  |

| TXT_Pg312_12 | Pg 312 (Text) | Therefore, 52 would indicate 520 in price and 104 would indicate 1040 for Cotton or any other commodity trading in 100 points to 1¢. |  |
| TXT_Pg312_14 | Pg 312 (Text) | We use 10 points to 1/8 inch on the daily high and low chart. |  |
| TXT_Pg312_15 | Pg 312 (Text) | Experience has proven that a scale of 25 points to 1/8 inch, which represents one week in Time, works best. |  |
| TXT_Pg312_16 | Pg 312 (Text) | Therefore, 52 spaces on the Calculator would indicate 1300 or 13¢ for Eggs; 104 would represent 2600; 156 would represent 3900; 208 would represent 5200 or 52¢ per dozen for Eggs, etc. |  |
| TXT_Pg312_17 | Pg 312 (Text) | One year Time Period would give a range of 13¢, 1/2 of this would be 6½ cents, 1/4 would be 325 and 1/8 would be 162. |  |
