It is better  than money in the bank.  You can never lose KNOWLEDGE and no one can  STEAL it from YOU; therefore, get all the KNOWLEDGE YOU possibly can. CONCLUSION I have written this course of instructions, SPECULATION A PROFITABLE  PROFESSION to help others make a success trading in Commodities.  There is no  greater pleasure in life than rendering good service to others.
